## Microstrip Boards

Microstrip evaluation boards to determine the 50 ohm microstrip width using OSH Park's 4-layer stackup.  Four 50 mm long microstrip boards with end-launch SMA connectors were designed; 0.34, 0.36, 0.38, and 0.40 mm widths.  The calculated 50 ohm width should be around 0.34 mm, however, the measured 50 ohm width is around 0.38 mm.
