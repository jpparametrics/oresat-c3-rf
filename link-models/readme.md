### Link budget models for the C3 communications channels

The source of these spreadsheets are from Jan King and are located at the [AMSAT-UK IARU website](http://www.amsatuk.me.uk/iaru/spreadsheet.htm)

- The primary uplink (L band) and downlink (UHF) link model:
___AMSAT-IARU_Link_Model_Rev2.5.5_mod_PDX_CS0_primary.xlsx___
  - The 'Transmitters' and 'Receivers' pages have been customized. Refer to these [block diagrams](https://github.com/oresat/oresat-c3-rf/tree/master/block-diagrams)
  - The 'System Performance Summary' page has broken references for transmitters and receivers details, but the link budget reference is accurate.  Use the 'Transmitters', 'Receivers', 'Uplink Budget', and 'Downlink Budget' pages for details.

- The secondary uplink (UHF) link model:
___Work in progress.___
